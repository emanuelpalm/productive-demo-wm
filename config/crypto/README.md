# Certificates and Other Cryptographic Primitives

This folder is meant to contain all certificates required to run all systems that need to be part of the two Arrowhead
local clouds of this demonstrator. As it isn't a good practice to check in lots of binary blobs with high likelihood of
being changed in the future, the [`mk_certs.sh`](../scripts/mk_certs.sh) is used to specify the details about and
generate all those certificates.
